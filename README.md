Currently Working on:

* Project Status:
* We are dropping Handlebars unless anyone really wants to use it.
* The project is modeled after Week 14 Activity 14 Post-Author-Joins Where the Author is now the User, the Posts are now Plants and we have a third table for Images that is connected to Plants.
* Models: Done, I am going to draw a diagram for them.
* Config: Done, I took care of it
* Node_Modules: Done, all needed libraries are installed and in package.json
* Public:
* Public/CSS: No CSS work done yet
* public/js: used for API calls, event listeners, etc. Not done
* public/html: not done other than upload route.
* Routes: no routes are done besides the upload route. (edited)
